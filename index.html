            The master department of interior architecture at KABK publish a magazine annually to review the activities taking place in and outside of the academy. Together with Linea C. Fabricius I designed the 10th issue of the INSIDE Magazine, under the theme ‘Situated Knowledges’. The design is an attempt to relate the content with it’s physical origin, using scanned cut-outs, and hand-drawn underlining and circling to contextualise the vast and sometimes confusing content. We took inspiration from the newspaper format, to emphasise the urgency of the graduation projects, and structured the publication in four sections, bound separately in a print-run of a 1.000 copies. Each section was printed on different paper, using leftovers from the print house, and shaped by a close collaboration with the client.
